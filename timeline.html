            <p>In Kibbutz Be'eri, Nahal Oz, and Kerem Shalom, families were torn from their slumber by deafening blasts and the staccato rattle of gunfire. Parents raced to sealed safe rooms clutching children; neighbors banged on doors, warning of the onslaught.</p>
            
            <div class="witness-account">
              <p>We woke to the sound of explosions. At first, I thought it was another rocket attack, but then we heard gunfire—much closer than we'd ever heard before. My husband looked outside and just said, "They're here." We grabbed our children and ran to the safe room.</p>

            <p>The Red Alert warning system activated across dozens of southern communities as rockets streamed from Gaza. Emergency services began receiving distressed calls reporting gunfire and explosions in communities near the border.</p>
            
            <p>Security forces, initially responding to what they believed was a routine rocket attack, quickly realized the unprecedented nature of the assault as reports of armed infiltrators flooded emergency channels. The scope of the attack became apparent as multiple breach points were identified along the border fence.</p>

First responders worked beyond exhaustion to save lives. These acts of humanity remind us that even in our most vulnerable moments, the human spirit endures.</p>
