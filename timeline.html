            <p>In Kibbutz Be'eri, Nahal Oz, and Kerem Shalom, families were torn from their slumber by deafening blasts and the staccato rattle of gunfire. Parents raced to sealed safe rooms clutching children; neighbors banged on doors, warning of the onslaught.</p>
            
            <div class="witness-account">
              <p>We woke to the sound of explosions. At first, I thought it was another rocket attack, but then we heard gunfireâ€”much closer than we'd ever heard before. My husband looked outside and just said, "They're here." We grabbed our children and ran to the safe room.</p>

            <p>Security forces, initially responding to what they believed was a routine rocket attack, quickly realized the unprecedented nature of the assault as reports of armed infiltrators flooded emergency channels. The scope of the attack became apparent as multiple breach points were identified along the border fence.</p>

            <p>Military reinforcements began arriving at some communities, but the widespread nature of the attacks meant many areas remained vulnerable. Helicopters that attempted to evacuate wounded residents came under fire, complicating rescue efforts.</p>

First responders worked beyond exhaustion to save lives. These acts of humanity remind us that even in our most vulnerable moments, the human spirit endures.</p>
        <p>This timeline serves as both documentation and memorialâ€”a commitment to remember those lost, honor those who survived, and ensure that their stories are told for generations to come.</p>
