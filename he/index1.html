      <p>
	  In the predawn hours of October 7, 2023, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades—the armed wing of Hamas, along with Arab Palestinian civilian mobs launched a surprise, large-scale assault from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel.

        The wave of terror swept across southern Israel.
        Terrorists breached border communities, transforming everyday life into a fight for survival.
        In just hours, nearly <strong>1,200</strong> lives were lost—859 civilians and 274 soldiers—and
        over 250 were taken hostage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parents in kibbutzim such as Be’eri and Nir Oz sheltered children in locked rooms as gunfire
        echoed outside. Emergency sirens pierced the night, and over 630 wounded were rushed to
        overwhelmed hospitals.

        In the days after, makeshift relief centers provided food, shelter, and medical aid. Schools
        became clinics, and gyms housed families seeking safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acts of kindness blossomed: artists painted murals to uplift spirits, bakers handed out bread at
        checkpoints, and local eateries fed all comers without charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Late at night, villages were silent except for whispered prayers and lantern-lit pathways guiding
        those in need.

	  During the attack on the Supernova Sukkot Gathering, an open-air music festival near Kibbutz Re’im held in celebration of Shemini Atzeret, gunmen and rocket fire 
	  claimed the lives of 378 people (344 festivalgoers and 34 security personnel) and left many more wounded. Amid the chaos, attackers abducted 44 men, women, and 
	  children and subjected some of the hostages to sexual violence. Israeli security forces engaged the militants at the festival site, killing around 
	  twenty of the assailants in the ensuing firefight.

        While horror reigned, heroes emerged: neighbors carried the hurt to safety, and ZAKA
        volunteers, lanterns in hand, recovered the fallen with dignity.
